# üêü Fish Classification and Smart Navigation System

This project integrates *Computer Vision, **Reinforcement Learning, and **Markov Models* to classify fish species and navigate a dynamic environment using intelligent agents. It demonstrates a powerful combination of machine learning models working together in a simulated or real-time system.

## üöÄ Technologies Used

‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†*Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)*  
  MobileNetV2 is used for lightweight and accurate fish classification from images.

‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†*Q-Learning*  
  Reinforcement learning algorithm used to guide multiple agents through a dynamic environment with changing obstacles.

‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†*Markov Model*  
  A probabilistic model used for predicting state transitions within the environment or fish movement.

## üß† Project Architecture

### 1. Fish Classifier (CNN using MobileNetV2)
‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†Trained on a dataset of labeled fish images.
‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†Outputs the predicted fish species.
‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†Optimized for real-time inference on constrained hardware.

### 2. Multi-Agent Q-Learning
‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†Each agent maintains its own Q-table.
‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†The environment is represented as a grid with target and dynamic obstacles.
‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†Agents learn optimal policies to reach the goal without collisions.

### 3. Markov Model for State Transitions
‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†Defines the probabilistic transitions between environment states.
‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†Helps agents anticipate obstacle or fish movement and adapt their strategy.
